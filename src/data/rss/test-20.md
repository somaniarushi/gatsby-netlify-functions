Words are tricky and words are nice. Spelling nerds take special note: The next event to be simulated at TechVista, 2018- HiveMind invites you! The general rules for the event are as follows: Number of participants: 1 Number of rounds: 2 The first would be a written round wherein the participants would be required to write the spellings of the words pronounced. There would be a total of 25 words in the first round. The top 5 participants will qualify for the second round. The second round will be an oral round. The speller may ask the pronouncer to repeat or define the word or give a sentence including the word. Only the British spelling system is deemed valid. The pronouncerâs judgement on the correct spellings of the word, including the validity of alternative spellings, shall be final and binding. See you at TechVista, 2018! Warm regards, Team TechVista
