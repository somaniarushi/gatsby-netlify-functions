Debate is an attempt to cling to the illusion of control provided by a point of view designed to keep the ego in place, an attempt to dance with the unknown at the risk of losing what we think we know. So debaters, get ready to crush the opposition at the Clash of Titans to be simulated at TechVista, 2018! The general rules for the debate are as follows: The topic for the first round is, 'The House believes that regulation laws have failed in keeping up with the modern technological evolutions.' Number of Participants: 3 Number of Rounds: 2 The first round shall follow Oxford debate procedure. Out of the three speakers, one shall argue for the motion, one against the motion, and the third shall act as an interjector. Speaking time per participant for the first round shall be four minutes, with one minute for rebuttal. All teams shall be divided into 2 pools. Out of each pool, one team shall emerge as the winner. The winning teams from Round 1(each pool) shall proceed to Round 2, which shall follow a parliamentary form of debate, where each team shall have 3 speakers. The principal speakers will be allotted four minutes, followed by the second and the third speaker, who will also get four minutes to consolidate the teamâs argument. Each speech will follow a two minute rebuttal. The principal speakers for both sides shall provide the summing up speeches for an additional three minutes. See you at TechVista, 2018!
