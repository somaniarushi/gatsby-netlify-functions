Journalism can never be silent: that is its greatest virtue and its greatest fault. It must speak, and speak immediately, while the echoes of wonder, the claims of triumph and the signs of horror are still in the air. Presenting before you the media division at TechVista, 2018- The Hermes Troops! The general rules for the event are as follows: Number of participants: 2 (1 reporter & 1 photographer) The participants would be asked to design a newsletter on the software of their choice.
