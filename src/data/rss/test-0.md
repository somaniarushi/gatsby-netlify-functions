Dear questers, It is, as we write this, 12:00 A.M. on the 25th, and that means that our quiz has officially been shut down. The rankings are up for display on the website leaderboard, and we extend our warmest congratulations to all the winners. To all the participants of IT Quest, thank you for your time and effort. It was a joy to keep the quiz up and running when we had people tracking our every step and analyzing every minute detail. So, for perhaps one last time, Toil and trouble. Team TechVista
