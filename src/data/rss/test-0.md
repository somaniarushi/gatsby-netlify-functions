We were proud to honor our outgoing cohort of [Startup Semester](https://scet.berkeley.edu/startup-semester) students at their graduation ceremony, held on Friday, May 8, 2020. Our Spring 2020 cohort features 18 students, hailing from 5 different countries. The event highlighted short speeches by three participants â Anushka Purohit, Anupam Tiwari and Anant Mishra â who reflected on their classes, Startup Semester, and their overall experience as UC Berkeley students.

In addition to the masters of ceremonies, SCETâs director for Global Academic Programs, David Law, and the Global Programs Coordinator, Ricardo Rodriguez, the program also included remarks by SCET Chief Scientist & Faculty Director, Ikhlaq Sidhu, Chief Learning Officer & Managing Director, Ken Singer, Director of Global Engagement, Susan Giesecke, and Lecturer and Industry Fellow, Rick Rasmussen. The SCET leadership team was able to lend words of wisdom about the challenges and opportunities surfaced by COVID-19, share thoughts about the program, and advise the outgoing class on the importance of âpaying it forward.â

Our impressive cohort of global students also penned descriptive blog posts about their experiences, as part of the Startup Semester âSilicon Valley Immersionâ class.

> âIf one aims to build a multi-million dollar company then this is definitely the place to be. No matter what background weâre coming from or at what stage of life weâre currently at. We just need to have that thriving passion in us, rest assured weâll be driven along the way of advancing our idea/vision from stage 0 to 1. I was just a sophomore student with few technical skills prior to this program and I can arguably say things have completely pivoted after being a part of this, it has definitely groomed me to be a better person in this competitive world,â**wrote** **Jaideep Cherukuri.**

> âI would say that spending a semester at Berkeley is a once in a lifetime opportunity which one shouldnât miss if given a chance. You would be surprised about your capabilities and the extent to which you can push yourself to get things done. You get to meet amazing professors and students, you get to be a part of amazing clubs and communities and you get to learn and experience different ways and methods which would surely help you in your future endeavors,â**wrote****Sai Rishvanth Katragadda.**

> People here donât just believe in what you say until they try and apply their knowledge, skills to prove another person wrong. And I see this as a great thing as it creates a space for innovation and crazy ideas. And I think this is the reason why most of the start-ups which start from here end up being either acquired by a big company or become a big company to acquire start-ups from UCB âYour friendly neighborhood Silicon Valley,â**wrote Sajan Kumar.**
