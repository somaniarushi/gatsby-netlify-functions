Debugging is twice as hard as programming because if debugging is the process of removing bugs, then programming must be the process of putting them in. Presenting before you the next event to be simulated at TechVista, 2018 -- BrainBug! The general rules for the event are as follows: Number of participants per school : 1 Number of rounds: 1 All codes in the questions will be in Java and C++ languages. The questions mentioned will be of the following types: Error rectification: The participants will have to rectify the errors in the program so as to get the given output. Hidden Code: Participants are to fill the missing code so as to get the given output. Rearrangement: Participants are to rearrange the disordered parts in correct order to get the given output. Predict the Output: participants are to predict the desired output. See you at TechVista'18! Warm regards, Team TechVista
